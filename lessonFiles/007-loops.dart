   * Dart Loop:
   * Loop statements are used to execute the block of code repeatedly,
   * for a specified number of times or until it meets a specified condition.
   * =========================
   * [01] For loop:
   * The for loop is used when we want to execute block of code known times
   * Syntax:
   * for ( Initialization; Condition; incr/decr ) { // Code to repeat  }
   * Exp: 01
   * =========================
   * [02] Dart for..in Loop
   * The for in loop takes an expression or object as iterator,
   * And iterate through the elements one at a time in sequence
   * Syntax: for ( var in expression ) { // code to repeat }
   * Exp: 02
   * =========================
   * [03] Dart while loop
   * The while loop will execute a block of statement as long as a test expression is true.
   * Syntax:
   * while ( condition ) { // Code to repear; incr/decr }
   * Exp: 03
   * =========================
   * [04] Dart do while loop
   * The doâ€¦while statement executes loop statements and then test the condition for next iteration and executes next only if condition is true.
   * Syntax: 
   * do { // Code to execute // this code run the first time before check the condition  } while ( condition );
   * Exp: 04
   * =========================
   * Dart Break statement
   * The break statement inside any loop gives you way to break or terminate the execution of loop containing it, 
   * and transfers the execution to the next statement following the loop.
   * It is almost always used with if..else statements
   * Syntax: 
   * break;
   * Exp: 05
   * =========================
   * Dart Continue Statement
   * The continue statement gives you way to skip over the current iteration of any loop.
   * Syntax:
   * continue;
   * Exp: 06
   * =========================
   * Loop throug map skiped until learn maps
