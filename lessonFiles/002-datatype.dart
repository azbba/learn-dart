   * Dart Data Types:
   * To get data type of variable we use 
   * Exp: [ variable.runtimeType ].
   * int age = 30;
   * print( age.runtimeType ); // int
   * =========================================
   * [01]: String     =>
   * A string variable is used to hold series or sequence of characters – letters, numbers, and special characters.
   * String can be represented either using single quotes [ '' ] or double quotes [ "" ].
   * Strings can be declared using the String keyword
   * Exp:
   * String name = "AzBba";
   * =========================================
   * [02]: int:
   * Integers are used to store whole numbers.
   * An integer data type is used to represent 64 bit non-decimal number between -263 to 263 – 1.
   * An integer can be used to store either signed and unsigned integer value.
   * Integers can be declared using [ int ] keyword.
   * Exp:
   * int age = 30;
   * =========================================
   * [03]: double:
   * Double is used to represent a 64-bit (double-precision) floating-point numbers or numbers with larger decimal points.
   * Double can be declared using [ double ] keyword.
   * Exp:
   * double prix = 15.2;
   * =========================================
   * [04]: bool       =>
   * The Boolean data type is used to represent the truth values.
   * which can be either [ true ] or [ false ].
   * You cannot use [ 0 ] or [ 1 ] to represent [ true ] or [ false ].
   * Boolean can be declared using bool keyword.
   * Exp:
   * boolean appStatus = true;
   * =========================================
   * [05]: list:
   * List data type is used to represent a collection of objects.
   * A List is an ordered group of objects.
   * The List data type in Dart is synonymous to the concept of an [ array ] in other programming languages.
   * An array is used to hold multiple values in single variable.
   * A list variable is defined by having values separated by commas [ , ] and enclosed within square brackets ( [] ).
   * Exp:
   * List languages = [ "Dart", "Flutter", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", "PHP", "MySQL" ];
   * =========================================
   * [06]: set:
   * A set in Dart is an unordered collection of unique items. 
   * Two elements in a set cannot be equal.
   * Dart support for sets is provided by set literals and the Set type.
   * Exp:
   * Set fruits = { "apple", "apricot", "avocado", "banana" };
   * =========================================
   * [07]: map:
   * The Map is an object that is used to represents a set of values as key-value pairs.
   * Both keys and values can be of any type of object.
   * In Map, each key can only occurs once, but the same value can be used multiple times.
   * The Map can be defined by using curly braces [ {} ].
   * and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ( [] ).
   * Exp:
   * 
      Map userInfo = {
        "username": "AzBba",
        "email":    "az34bba@gmail.com",
        "age":      30,
        "status":   true
      };
      print( userInfo );
      print( userInfo["email"] ); // Access to values by key name
   * =========================================
